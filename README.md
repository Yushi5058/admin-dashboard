#Admin Dashboard

## A full designed admin dashboard with HTML and CSS 

### About the project

The project is an admin dashboard made for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard) curriculum. It is only made with html and css. The website is not yet responsive.
It is made to learn more about the concept of Grid CSS and to practice UI / UX design skills.

## Conclusion 

I learnt so many things about CSS grid by searching, reading and learning across all the web resources from blogs, articles, newsletters, MDN documentation and so on.
The CSS grid is a wonderful tool who will make me doing layouts easier than before, alongside flexbox who helped me too in this project.
I'm trying to upgrade my design skills to a better level everyday, and I hope I can achieve that. 
I got some ideas about how to implement javascript, and a database to make the project more than just a static page in the future.
