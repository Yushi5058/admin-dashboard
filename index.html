          <h1>Object Detection with YOLO</h1>
          <p class="project-para">YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real-time object detection algorithm that uses a single deep neural network to identify objects within an image. YOLO divides an image into a grid and uses anchor boxes to make predictions at each cell. YOLO is fast and accurate, making it a popular choice for applications such as self-driving cars and security systems.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card card__project">
          <h1>Sentiment Analysis</h1>
          <p class="project-para">Sentiment Analysis is the process of determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text, such as a tweet or a review. It is commonly used in marketing to analyze customer opinions, in politics to gauge public sentiment, and in social media to monitor online conversations. Sentiment Analysis models are usually trained on large datasets and can use techniques such as lexicon-based, rule-based, and machine learning.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card card__project">
          <h1>Music Generation with LSTMs</h1>
          <p class="project-para">LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) used in generating music. Music generation models are trained on large music datasets and can generate new pieces based on the input. LSTMs are particularly useful in music generation because they can store long-term dependencies between musical notes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card card__project">
          <h1>Recommender System</h1>
          <p class="project-para">A Recommender System is an AI-based system that suggests items to users based on their preferences. Recommender Systems use techniques such as Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, and Hybrid Approaches to make recommendations. They are commonly used in e-commerce, media streaming, and social media platforms.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card card__project">
          <h1>Chatbot with NLP</h1>
          <p class="project-para">NLP (Natural Language Processing) is a field of AI that deals with understanding and processing human language. Chatbots are computer programs designed to simulate conversation with human users. NLP is used in Chatbots to understand and generate human-like responses to user inputs. Chatbots can be used for customer service, marketing, and entertainment purposes.</p>
          </div>
        <div class="card card__project">
          <h1>Image Classification with CNNs</h1>
          <p class="project-para">CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) are a type of deep learning model used in image classification. Image classification involves assigning a label to an image based on its content. CNNs are particularly effective in image classification tasks due to their ability to automatically learn hierarchical representations of images. They have been widely used in applications such as image recognition, object detection, and self-driving cars.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card card__project">
          <h1>Speech Recognition with Deep Learning</h1>
          <p class="project-para">Deep learning models for speech recognition process audio signals to transcribe speech into text. These models typically use techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to identify speech patterns and map them to written language.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card card__project">
          <h1>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Image Synthesis</h1>
          <p class="project-para">GANs are a type of deep learning model that uses two neural networks to generate new, synthetic images. The generator network creates new images based on a training dataset, while the discriminator network evaluates the generated images and provides feedback to the generator. The two networks then continue to improve the generated images through an adversarial process.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card card__project">
          <h1>Natural Language Generation (NLG) with Transformers</h1>
          <p class="project-para">Transformers are a type of deep learning model that have been applied to various NLP tasks, including text classification and language translation. They can also be used for Natural Language Generation (NLG), where they generate human-like text based on a given prompt. Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to better understand the context of a prompt and generate more coherent and relevant responses.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card card__project">
          <h1>Object Tracking with Deep Learning</h1>
          <p class="project-para">Object tracking is the task of locating an object in consecutive video frames. Deep learning models can be used for object tracking, using techniques such as Siamese Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). These models can learn to track objects in real-time, making them useful for applications such as autonomous vehicles and video surveillance.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card card__project">
          <h1>Named Entity Recognition (NER) with Deep Learning</h1>
          <p class="project-para">Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the task of identifying and classifying named entities, such as people, organizations, and locations, in text. Deep learning models can be used for NER, using techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). These models can learn to identify named entities in text, making them useful for a variety of NLP tasks, such as information extraction and sentiment analysis.</p>

        <div class="card card__project">
          <h1>Image Segmentation with Deep Learning</h1>
          <p class="project-para">Image segmentation is the task of dividing an image into multiple segments, each representing a different object or background. Deep learning models can be used for image segmentation, using techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). These models can learn to segment images into meaningful regions, making them useful for tasks such as object detection and image classification.</p>
